# Medical-Healthcare-Dapp
A decentralized medical healthcare DApp, enabling secure storage of patient records and medical reports on the Ethereum blockchain. Built with React.js for frontend, MongoDB for storing data, and Truffle for blockchain development.

## Doctor Functions
- **Create Medical Records**: Enables doctors to create medical records for patients securely stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **View Medical Records**: Allows doctors to view existing medical records of patients with authorized access.

## Patient Functions
- **Grant Doctor Access**: Patients can grant permission to doctors to access their medical records.
- **Remove Doctor Access**: Allows patients to remove a doctor from the authorized list, revoking their access to medical records.
- **Fetch Authorized Doctors**: Patients can fetch a list of doctors who have access to their medical records.
- **Get Doctor Information**: Patients can retrieve information about authorized doctors.

## Future Development Plan
- **Appointment Management Function**: We'll use ERC tokens to handle appointments, making everything safer and smoother for users. These tokens can also help with payments or other transactions.
- **UI UX Improvement**: We're going to keep making our app easier to use and nicer to look at. This means listening to what users say and making changes to how the app looks and works.
- **Automatic PDFs for Medical Records**: When a doctor creates a new record, we'll automatically turn it into a PDF and save it securely on the blockchain. This keeps things organized and safe for everyone involved.
